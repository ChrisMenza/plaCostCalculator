# plaCostCalculator
Provided that your 3D printer software tells you how much PLA it uses for a print, 
and you know how much a 1KG of PLA costs not including tax ($20). This program will add the tax for you,
you can use this to tell you how much it costs for a print.

I will continue adding the features listed below to this program in the near future.
* Electrical cost of printer per print
* Ability to ask the user how much PLA they are using if bigger or smaller than the set variable of 1000 grams

I know this is simple code but I hope you like it. Feel free to edit this yourself I dont care what you do to it.
